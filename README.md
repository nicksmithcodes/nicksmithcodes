- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a self-taught full stack web developer passionate about building web applications from the ground up. Without formal post-secondary education, Iâ€™ve been diving into coding through hands-on projects, open-source contributions, and continuous learning. My focus is on mastering both front-end and back-end skills, always looking for new challenges to push my understanding further.

- ðŸŒ± Currently working on improving my skills in JavaScript, frameworks like React and Node.js, and exploring new tools in the dev stack.

- ðŸš€ Goals: Build meaningful projects, connect with like-minded devs, and eventually contribute to open-source communities in a big way.

- ðŸ’¡ Fun fact: My favorite way to learn is by doingâ€”so youâ€™ll often find me tinkering with code, debugging, and breaking things along the way!
